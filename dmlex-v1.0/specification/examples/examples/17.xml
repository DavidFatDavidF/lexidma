    <title>Modelling subentries (at subsense level)</title>
    <para>We have an entry for the adjective "safe" with two senses, and an entry for the multi-word
        expression "better safe than sorry" with one sense. We want to express the fact that the
        multi-word entry should appear under the first sense of "safe" as a subentry.</para>
    <example>
        <title>Pseudocode</title>
        <programlisting>
- lexicographicResource (language: en)
    - entry (id: safe, headword: safe)
        - sense (id: safe-1, indicator: protected from harm)
            - example (text: It isn't safe to park here.)
        - sense (id: safe-2, indicator: not likely to cause harm)
            - example (text: Is the ride safe for a small child?)
    - entry (id: better-safe, headword: better safe than sorry)
        - sense (id: better-safe-1)
            - definition (text: you should be careful even if it seems unnecessary)
    - relation (type: subentrying)
        member (memberID: safe-1, role: container)
        member (memberID: better-safe, role: subentry)
    - relationType (type: subentrying, scope: sameResource)
        - memberType (role: container, memberType: sense, min: 1, max: 1, action: navigate)
        - memberType (role: subentry, memberType: entry, min: 1, max: 1, action: embed)
