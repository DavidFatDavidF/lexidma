    <a:documentation>RelaxNG XML schema for OASIS DMLex lexicographic resources.</a:documentation>
    <a:documentation>Notes: 1. The XML serialisation does not consistently follow the DMLex
        distinction into object (which are naturally modelled as XML elements) properties (which are
        naturally modelled as element attributes in XML) and but rather models the properties that
        can contain free text (e.g. definition, text, value) as XML elements. In this we follow the
        TEI principle, where attributes should not contain free text, also, otherwise these
        properties could not contain mark-up as described in the Inline Markup Module. Note that the
        casing remains the same as in the abstract model, i.e. elements based on object are
        capitalised (eg. LexicographicResource), and elements based on properties start with lower
        case (e.g. homographNumber). 2. For DMLex property "id" we used the XML attribute "xml:id"
        and for "langauge" we use "xml:lang". 3. XML does not model the listingOrder property, as
        this corresponds to the order of elements in XML. 4. There are several pointing attributes
        in DMLex. However, they are (mostly) not given IDREF datatypes, as the specification writes
        that a DMLex resources does not enforce "referential integrity" 5. Whether the children
        elements are allowed to appear in any order or in the order specified in the specification
        has been determined on a case-by-case basis.</a:documentation>
