  <title><literal>RelevanceRelation</literal> relation type</title>
  <para> Represents the fact that two or more senses (typically - but not necessarily - belonging to
    two different entries) are relevant to each other, in ways other than opposition and similarity.
    This relation type is suitable for connecting words (more accurately: senses of words) which are
    connected to one another in experience (= one encounters them together) but are not any kind of
    "nyms", eg. <emphasis>money</emphasis>, <emphasis>pay</emphasis>, <emphasis>bill</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>charge</emphasis>...</para>
