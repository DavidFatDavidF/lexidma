  <para>
    Represents the fact that a group of senses (all belonging to the
    same entry) should be grouped when presented to a human user.
    Typically, when an entry has a large number of senses, it is a
    convenience to the human user to group them into a smaler number of
    groups by some broad criterion, such as by part of speech or by
    semantic similarity.
