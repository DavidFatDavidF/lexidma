      <para><literal>idref</literal>

      <para><literal>role</literal>
        <glossterm>optional</glossterm> (zero or one). Non-empty string. An indication of the role
        the member has in this relation: whether it is the hypernym or the hyponym (in a
        hyperonymy/hyponymy relation), or whether it is one of the synonyms (in a synonymy
        relation), and so on. You can use <code><olink targetptr="linking_memberRole"
            >memberRole</olink></code> objects to explain those roles and to constrain which
        relations are allowed to contain which roles, what their object types are allowed to be (eg.
        entries or senses) and how many members with this role each relation is allowed to
        have.</para>

        <glossterm>required</glossterm> (exactly one). Number. The position of this member among other members of the same
        relation. It should be respected when showing members of the relation to human users. This
        can be implicit from the serialization.</para>

        <glossterm>required</glossterm> (exactly one). Number. The position of this relation among other relations
        this member is involved in. It should be respected when showing the relations of this
        member to a human user. This can be implicit from the serialization.</para>
