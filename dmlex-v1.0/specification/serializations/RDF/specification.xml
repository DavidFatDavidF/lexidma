      <para>The RDF serialization used in this document follows the following principles</para>
      <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
              <para>The <code>lexicographicResource</code> object is an individual of type <code>dmlex:LexicographicResource</code></para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
              <para>All other objects are implemented as individuals</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
              <para>Each other object type is associated with a property (with a lowercase intiial letter) and a class (with an uppercase initial letter. In all case the range of this property is the class</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
              <para>Arity of properties is implemented by means of OWL class restrictions.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
              <para>Listing order can be specified with the property <code>dmlex:listingOrder</code> with values starting from 1 and ascending</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
              <para>The implementation is not aware of which modules are in use, to enable publishing on the web. As such cardinality constraints that are only required in a module are not implemented.</para>

      <title>Interoperability with OntoLex-lemon</title>
      <para>The ontology provides rules to infer an OntoLex-lemon model from DMLex data. This is achieved by means of subclass and subproperty axioms and so conversion can be performed by an OWL reasoner.</para>
